        Wilton Norman Chamberlain (August 21, 1936 ‚Äì October 12, 1999) was an American basketball player
        who played as a center and is considered one of the greatest players in history. He played for the
        Philadelphia/San Francisco Warriors, the Philadelphia 76ers, and the Los Angeles Lakers of the National
        Basketball Association (NBA). He played for the University of Kansas and also for the Harlem Globetrotters
        before playing in the NBA. Chamberlain stood 7 ft 1 in (2.16 m) tall, and weighed 250 pounds (110 kg) as a
        rookie[3] before bulking up to 275 and eventually to over 300 pounds (140 kg) with the Lakers.
        
        Chamberlain holds numerous NBA records in scoring, rebounding, and durability categories. He is the only player
        to score 100 points in a single NBA game or average more than 40 and 50 points in a season. He won seven
        scoring, eleven rebounding, and nine field goal percentage titles and led the league in assists once.[2]
        Chamberlain is the only player in NBA history to average at least 30 points and 20 rebounds per game in a
        season, which he accomplished seven times. He is also the only player to average at least 30 points and 20
        rebounds per game over the entire course of his NBA career. Although he suffered a long string of losses in the
        playoffs,[4] Chamberlain had a successful career, winning two NBA championships, earning four regular-season
        Most Valuable Player awards, the Rookie of the Year award, one NBA Finals MVP award, and was selected to 13
        All-Star Games and ten All-NBA First and Second teams.[1][5] He was subsequently enshrined in the Naismith
        Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1978, elected into the NBA's 35th Anniversary Team of 1980, and in 1996 he
        was chosen as one of the 50 Greatest Players in NBA History.[5]

        Chamberlain was known by several nicknames during his basketball playing career. He hated the ones that called
        attention to his height, such as "Goliath" and "Wilt the Stilt". A Philadelphia sportswriter coined the
        nicknames during Chamberlain's high school days. He preferred "The Big Dipper", which was inspired by his
        friends who saw him dip his head as he walked through doorways.[6] After his professional basketball career
        ended, Chamberlain played volleyball in the short-lived International Volleyball Association, was president of
        that organization, and is enshrined in the IVA Hall of Fame for his contributions.[7] He was a successful
        businessman, authored several books, and appeared in the movie Conan the Destroyer. He was a lifelong bachelor
        and became notorious for his claim of having had sexual relations with as many as 20,000 women.
